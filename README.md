# Timetable to Calendar Converter

This app converts timetable pdf to csv file, the csv file can then be exported to Google Calendar.

The purpose of this app is to encourage students to use calendar app as their time management tool.

(Currently, the deployed streamlit app is not working, will try rewrite the app in flask or Django)
